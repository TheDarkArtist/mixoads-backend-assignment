## Part 1: What Was Broken

#### Issue 1: Hardcoded credentials and sensitive data logging

**What was wrong:**
The sync logic hardcodes API credentials directly in source code and logs both the Base64-encoded Basic Authorization header and the issued Bearer access token to stdout.

**Why it mattered:**
This results in immediate credential exposure via logs and source control, violating basic security hygiene. In a real production system this would constitute a critical incident requiring key rotation and log scrubbing.

**Where in the code:**
Authentication logic and logging in `syncAllCampaigns` (`src/syncCampaigns.ts`).

---

#### Issue 2: Incomplete pagination leading to data loss

**What was wrong:**
The campaign fetch logic retrieves only the first page of results and ignores the pagination metadata (`has_more`, `total`). As a result, only 10 of the expected 100 campaigns are processed.

**Why it mattered:**
This causes silent data loss and incorrect business state, which is more dangerous than explicit failures because it may go unnoticed.

**Where in the code:**
Campaign fetching logic in `syncAllCampaigns` (`src/syncCampaigns.ts`).

---

#### Issue 3: No rate limit handling despite explicit API constraints

**What was wrong:**
The client makes sequential API requests without any awareness of the platform’s enforced rate limit (10 requests per minute). Responses with HTTP 429 are not handled, and the `retry-after` signal is ignored.

**Why it mattered:**
Under realistic conditions the sync process will reliably exceed rate limits, resulting in cascading failures and incomplete syncs.

**Where in the code:**
All API request paths in `syncAllCampaigns` (`src/syncCampaigns.ts`).

---

#### Issue 4: Missing retry strategy for transient failures

**What was wrong:**
The API intentionally returns transient 503 errors and simulated timeouts, but the client does not implement retries, exponential backoff, or jitter. Failures are either thrown or logged and skipped.

**Why it mattered:**
This makes the sync process non-deterministic and unreliable, producing different results across runs for the same input.

**Where in the code:**
API request handling and sync loop in `syncAllCampaigns` (`src/syncCampaigns.ts`).

---

#### Issue 5: Incorrect timeout configuration

**What was wrong:**
The campaign sync endpoint intentionally responds after ~2 seconds, while the client timeout for the same request is configured to 1 second. This guarantees avoidable timeouts under normal operation.

**Why it mattered:**
Artificially short timeouts amplify failure rates and mask true performance characteristics of the system.

**Where in the code:**What was wrong: Authentica
`fetchWithTimeout` usage during campaign sync (`src/syncCampaigns.ts`).

---

#### Issue 6: Unsafe and inefficient database access patterns

**What was wrong:**
A new database connection pool is created per insert, queries are constructed using string interpolation, and there is no deduplication or idempotency guarantee.

**Why it mattered:**
This can lead to connection leaks, SQL injection vulnerabilities, duplicate records, and poor scalability.

**Where in the code:**
Database access logic in `saveCampaignToDB` (`src/database.ts`).

---

#### Issue 7: Overloaded “god function” architecture

**What was wrong:**
Authentication, API communication, retry logic, business orchestration, persistence, and logging are all implemented within a single function.

**Why it mattered:**
This tight coupling increases cognitive load, makes testing difficult, and raises the risk that fixing one issue introduces regressions elsewhere.

**Where in the code:**
`syncAllCampaigns` (`src/syncCampaigns.ts`).

## Part 2: How I Fixed It

For each issue above, explain your fix in detail.

### Fix 1: Authentication security

**My approach:**
Removed hardcoded API credentials from source code and loaded them from environment variables. Eliminated logging of authorization headers and access tokens, and added fail-fast validation when required configuration is missing.

**Why this approach:**
Credential exposure is the highest-severity issue in the system. Fixing it first reduces immediate security risk without altering request flow or business logic.

**Trade-offs:**
The authentication mechanism itself (Basic auth → Bearer token) remains unchanged to match API requirements. Token refresh logic is intentionally deferred.

**Code changes:**
`src/syncCampaigns.ts`

## Part 3: Code Structure Improvements

Explain how you reorganized/refactored the code.

**What I changed:**
[Describe the new structure - what modules/files did you create?]

**Why it's better:**
[Improved testability? Separation of concerns? Reusability?]

**Architecture decisions:**
[Any patterns you used? Class-based? Functional? Why?]

---

## Part 4: Testing & Verification

How did you verify your fixes work?

**Test scenarios I ran:**
1. [Scenario 1 - e.g., "Ran sync 10 times to test reliability"]
2. [Scenario 2 - e.g., "Made 20 requests to test rate limiting"]
3. [etc.]

**Expected behavior:**
[What should happen when it works correctly?]

**Actual results:**
[What happened when you tested?]

**Edge cases tested:**
[What unusual scenarios did you test?]

---

## Part 5: Production Considerations

What would you add/change before deploying this to production?

### Monitoring & Observability
[What metrics would you track? What alerts would you set up?]

### Error Handling & Recovery
[What additional error handling would you add?]

### Scaling Considerations
[How would this handle 100+ clients? What would break first?]

### Security Improvements
[What security enhancements would you add?]

### Performance Optimizations
[What could be made faster or more efficient?]

---

## Part 6: Limitations & Next Steps

Be honest about what's still not perfect.

**Current limitations:**
[What's still not production-ready?]

**What I'd do with more time:**
[If you had another 5 hours, what would you improve?]

**Questions I have:**
[Anything you're unsure about or would want to discuss?]
